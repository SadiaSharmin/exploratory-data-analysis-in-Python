- ðŸŽ¯ We will see in this **`hands-on training notebook`** how to effectively diagnose and treat missing data in **Python**.
- ðŸ“Š The majority of **data science work** often revolves around **pre-processing data**, and making sure it's **ready for analysis**. However, **we will be covering how transform our raw data into accurate insights**. In this notebook, we will see:
   - Import data into **`pandas`**, and use simple functions to diagnose problems in our data.
   - Visualize **missing** and **out of range** data using **`missingno`** and **`seaborn`**.
   - **Apply a range of data cleaning tasks** that will ensure the delivery of accurate insights.
   - Make sure we have a clean dataset ready for data analysis.
