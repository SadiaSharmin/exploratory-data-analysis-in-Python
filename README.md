# ðŸ§¹ `Cleaning Data in Python` :
We will see in this **`hands-on training notebook`** how to effectively diagnose and treat missing data in **Python**. <br>
The majority of **data science work** often revolves around **pre-processing data**, and making sure it's **ready for analysis**. However, **we will be covering how transform our raw data into accurate insights**. In this notebook, we will see:
* Import data into **`pandas`**, and use simple functions to diagnose problems in our data.
* Visualize **missing** and **out of range** data using **`missingno`** and **`seaborn`**.
* **Apply a range of data cleaning tasks** that will ensure the delivery of accurate insights.
